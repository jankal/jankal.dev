# About me

Hey, I'm Alex 👋!

I've been developing websites and web-apps for <client-only><years-time date="2012-05-01"></years-time></client-only>.
During this time, I also founded the boutique software development agency <a href="https://zeraton.de">Zeraton</a>.

The main technologies and frameworks I use are:
- PHP (5 trough 8)
  - Laravel (5 trough 8)
  - Symfony (3 trough 5)
  - Cockpit CMS by <a href="https://twitter.com/agentejo">@agentejo</a>
  - Kirby CMS by <a href="https://twitter.com/bastianallgeier">@bastianallgeier</a>
- JavaScript / TypeScript (Frontend & Backend)
  - Vue.js
  - Nuxt.js
  - Basic React and Next.js knowledge

I can also do a fair amount of DevOps / Sysadmin things like
- Debian/Ubuntu server management (updates, firewalls, dns, logrotate)
- Secure configuration of Apache2 / nginx with php-fpm or as reverse-proxy / load-balancer
- Set up and use Docker, deploy to Kubernetes
- CI/CD configuration with GitLab CI or GitHub Actions

I mainly work un Windows utilizing WSL2 for my CLI needs.

I am located near Munich in Germany where I like to sail on Ammersee, Brombachsee or Bodensee.
For this hobby I obtained pleasurecraft ⛵ licenses valid for the EU.
I also like running 🏃‍♂️ and biking 🚴‍♂️ a lot.
